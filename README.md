# Model-Generation-w-Matplotlib

Author: Jonathan Xu & Jinming Xu

This piece of module was designed to use matplotlib to generate images and their XML files to make datasets to train a simple tensorflow modle that could detect shapes and their colors with transfer learning. This was used as a forerunner of a more advanced model using transfer learning to build an
autonomous lawnmower called Handibot.

Modules used:
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- random
- time
